- **verbalize the syntax**: the student describes a piece of program with many PL-words
  (e.g. `first`, `rest`, `empty`, the user-defined function names, and even quotes of the program).
  Furthermore, the description mentions the PL-words in the same order as they occur in the program.
- **paraphrase recursion**: the student describes what a function does without getting into its case splitting
  and without saying recursion explicitly.
  For example, *"loop until"* and *"remove all"* are considered a paraphrazed recursion.
  *"do the same for the rest"* is NOT considered a paraphrased recursion.
  (Application of this code suggests that the student has found the purpose of the function).
- **types**: the student claims a variable or an expression must be of a type.
  For example, *"... is supposed to be a list"*.
- **non-type constraints**: the student claims a variable or an expression must satisfy some restrictions.
  The restrction is not a type.
  For example, *"a list starting with the next nonequivalent element"*.
- **examples**: the student gives an example calls of a recursive function.
  The example might or might not be a trace.
  For example, *"the list 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 2 2 3 4 as input would produce 0 1 2 3 4"*
