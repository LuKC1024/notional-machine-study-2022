- **verbalize the syntax**: the student describes a piece of program with many PL-words
  (e.g. `first`, `rest`, `empty`, the user-defined function names, and even quotes of the program).
  Furthermore, the description mentions the PL-words in the same order as they occur in the program.
  (We need this code because students will likely organize more interesting explanation around applications of this code.)
- **purposes**: the student describes what a function does without getting into its case splitting
  and without saying recursion explicitly.
  That is, the student paraphrases the recursion.
  For example, *"loop until"* and *"remove all"* are considered a purpose.
  *"do the same for the rest"* is NOT considered a purpose.
  (Existance of applications of this code suggests that the student has came up with a purpose statement of the function).
- **examples**: the student gives an example calls of a recursive function.
  For example, *"the list 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 2 2 3 4 as input would produce 0 1 2 3 4"*.
- **trace**: the student gives a trace of call to a recursive function.
  - **trace with bindings**
  - **trace with hole/context**
- **properties**
  - **types**: the student claims a variable or an expression must be of a type.
    For example, *"... is supposed to be a list"*.
  - **non-type properties**: the student claims a variable or an expression must satisfy some restrictions.
    The restrction is not a type.
    For example, *"a list starting with the next nonequivalent element"*.

## Other things to include

does the student start with an examples or property-based description before describing the program, does the student refer to any underlying data structure or semantic feature, or do they mainly verbalize the syntax.

Think about what changes you hope to see in students' descriptions if your tools are successful, and build in the codes NOW so that these data become a useful baseline.
