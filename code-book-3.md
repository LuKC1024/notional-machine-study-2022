I will label each **sentence** with **no more than one** of the following tags:

- **verbalize the syntax**: the student describes a piece of program by reading off the syntactic constructs
  (e.g. `first`, `rest`, `empty`, the user-defined function names, and even quotes of the program),
  largely in the same order as they occur in the program.
  (This tag will likely help us to find applications of other tags)
- **examples**: the student gives an example calls of a recursive function.
  The student might or might not trace.
  For example, *"the list 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 2 2 3 4 as input would produce 0 1 2 3 4"*.
  (Application of this tag suggests that the student finds examples useful.
  Do those students who find examples useful enjoy notional machines more than other students?)
- **beyond the syntax**: the student makes some general (i.e. non-example) statements about the program.
  This include
  types (e.g. *"`alon` is supposed to be a list"*),
  purpose statements (e.g. *"the function `singles` replaces any repeated numbers with a single number"*),
  paraphrases of recursion (e.g. *"cutting off all the leading elements"*),
  and possibly other kind of statements
  (Application of this tag suggests that the student has a deeper understanding of the program beyond
  the syntax. Do students who have deeper understanding more likely to enjoy the Stacker?)

In addition, I will label each **response** with **zero or more** of the following tags:
- **reused names**: the student mentions that (formal) parameters of recursive functions are bound multiple times.
- **continuations**: the student mentions that something is waiting for the returned value of a recursive call.
- **...**
